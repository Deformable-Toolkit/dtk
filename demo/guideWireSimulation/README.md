# guideWireSimulation

A blood flow induced physical simulation of guidewire shape for virtual vascular intervention training system in real time. Virtual vascular intervention training system, which is a low cost, safe and effective solution, is able to provide an immersive virtual training environment for trainees.

## Dependencies

### [Boost](https://github.com/boostorg/boost)

&emsp;&emsp;Boost is a mandatory dependency of CGAL. Binary versions of Boost are available on SourceForge. The Boost installers install both Boost headers and precompiled libraries. Please note that the CGAL project is not responsible for the files provided on this website. When CGAL 5.2.1 was released, the latest version of Boost was 1.71. A typical installation of Boost would consist of the following steps:

&emsp;&emsp;Download and run the file boost_1_71_0-msvc-XX.Y-64.exe (where XX.Y = 14.0 for VC 2015, XX.Y = 14.1 for 2017, XX.Y = 14.2 for VC 2019).
Extract the files to a new directory, e.g. c:\dev\libboost_1_71_0.
Set the following two environment variables to point respectively to the path of the libraries and the headers
```bash
  BOOST_LIBRARYDIR = C:\dev\libboost_1_71_0\lib64-msvc-XX.Y
  BOOST_INCLUDEDIR = C:\dev\libboost_1_71_0
```
as this will help cmake to find Boost.
Add the path to the Boost dlls (C:\dev\libboost_1_71_0\lib64-msvc-XX.Y) files to the PATH environment variable.


### [CGAL](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal)

&emsp;&emsp;CGAL offers data structures and algorithms like triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, Polygons, Cell Complexes and Polyhedra, arrangements of curves, mesh generation, geometry processing, convex hull algorithms, to name just a few.

&emsp;&emsp;All these data structures and algorithms operate on geometric objects like points and segments, and perform geometric tests on them. These objects and predicates are regrouped in CGAL Kernels.

&emsp;&emsp;Finally, the Support Library offers geometric object generators and spatial sorting functions, as well as a matrix search framework and a solver for linear and quadratic programs. It further offers interfaces to third party software such as the GUI libraries Qt, Geomview, and the Boost Graph Library.

## How to build

&emsp;&emsp;guidewire simuation is build by CMake. so you can build easily by CMAKE GUI or command line. 

### build with CLI

Before congiguration. Modify the CMakeLists.txt in current folder first.

#### build executable program

&emsp;&emsp;Firstï¼Œconfiguarte with command:

```bash
$ cmake -S "SRC_DIR" -B "DESTINATION_DIR" -G "Generator"
```

&emsp;&emsp;second, compile with:

```bash
$ cmake --build "DESTINATION_DIR" --config Release
```
